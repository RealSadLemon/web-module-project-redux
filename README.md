# Redux React Module Project: Movie CRUD 

This module explored the redux philosophy, creation of the redux store and using connect to link state and action to arbitrary components.

## Introduction
In this project, I took a fairly complex application used to search a movie database and connect it to two different reducers through redux. I both connected existing state definitions and built entire reducer / redux pairings from scratch.
